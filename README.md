# Praxis 2.0 — GenAI + Machine Learning Innovation Showcase

Welcome to the official problem statement repository for **Praxis 2.0**, organized by **GDG on Campus – GB Pant**.

This repository contains the problem statements, rules, timelines, and submission expectations for the event.

---

## Overview

**Praxis 2.0** is a **GenAI + Machine Learning innovation showcase** where student teams design and build functional prototypes that address real-world challenges.

---

## What Participants Are Expected to Build

Teams are expected to deliver a **working prototype**, not just a concept.

A complete submission should demonstrate:
- A clear understanding of the problem
- Effective use of **Machine Learning** for analysis or prediction
- Meaningful use of **Generative AI** for reasoning, explanation, or insight generation
- Practical relevance and usability

---

## Expected Deliverables

Each team must submit the following:

- **Public GitHub Repository**  
  - Complete source code  
  - Clear README explaining the approach, architecture, and assumptions  

- **Demo Video**  
  - Short walkthrough of the working prototype  
  - Explanation of the problem, solution, and key insights  

- **Live Link (if hosted)**  
  - Web app, dashboard, or deployed service (optional but encouraged)  

- **Documentation**  
  - Model details and evaluation metrics  
  - Explanation of how ML + GenAI are integrated  
  - Any ethical, bias, or limitation considerations
---
## 📊 Data, Modeling & Reasoning Note

For each problem statement, a **curated dataset will be provided** to participants as a baseline.

Teams are expected to apply **Machine Learning techniques** for tasks such as prediction, forecasting, segmentation, classification, or pattern discovery, using appropriate evaluation metrics.

To support explanation, reasoning, summarization, and insight generation, teams may use **Generative AI**, including:
- Open-source large language models  
- Free-tier APIs such as **Gemini**

The choice of tools, frameworks, or architectures is left open.

Submissions should demonstrate **meaningful integration of ML + GenAI**, where analytical outputs are translated into **clear, human-understandable insights**.

> GenAI may be used in any form that improves reasoning, visualization or decision support.

---

## Final Note

Praxis 2.0 values:
- Thoughtful problem framing  
- Sound technical reasoning  
- Responsible use of AI  
- Clear communication of insights  

There is **no single correct solution**. Creativity and depth will be rewarded alongside technical rigor.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing what you build 🚀
